		<h2>My Favorite Hobbies</h2>
		<p>I love to spend my free time watching movies. There's nothing quite like getting lost in a great story or laughing along with a hilarious comedy. Some of my favorites include The Godfather, The Dark Knight, and Pulp Fiction.</p>

	<p>When I'm not watching movies, I enjoy playing sports like cricket. I find it to be a great way to stay active and meet new people. It's also a great way to challenge myself and improve my skills.</p>

	<p>Another one of my favorite hobbies is photography. I find it to be a great creative outlet, and I love being able to capture beautiful moments and memories through the lens of my camera. Whether I'm taking pictures of nature, people, or architecture, I always strive to create something unique and beautiful.</p>
